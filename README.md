# CalibRaw
CalibRaw is a fast, GPU-accelerated RAW photo editor. <br>
It was made not to focus on design, but to be performant and non-destructive to the export.

I developed this project to provide a performant, approachable, open-source RAW editing workflow. <br>
CalibRaw is available for Linux, Android, Windows, and macOS, with Linux and Android being the primary focus.

## Key Features

- **GPU-accelerated:** Built with Rust, wgpu, and custom WGSL compute shaders for real-time performance.
- **Non-destructive:** All edits and adjustments are non-destructive and saved to lightweight `.calibraw` sidecar files.
- **Advanced demosaicing:** Features Bayer RCD, Fujifilm X-Trans (Markesteijn), and noise-resilient Dual Demosaicing.
- **Masking:** Supports brush and shape masks with independent tone curves and adjustments.
- **Creative effects:** Unique mask effects like light rays, lens blur, motion blur, fog, Glow, and more.
- **Optional AI:** Local Subject & Object masks, [AI Denoise](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable-ai), and AI object removal.
- **Multi-platform:** Native builds for Linux, Android, Windows, and macOS.
- **Flexible export:** High-quality export to PNG, JPEG, and color-managed TIFF.
- **HDR merge:** Select two or more RAW exposures in the desktop library, right-click, and choose **HDR merge**. Small camera shifts and rotations are aligned automatically, and an editable `-HDR.tif` is saved beside the first selected source. The 32-bit scene-linear Rec.2020 master preserves the highlight and shadow range captured across the bracket. Use exposures of the same static scene from the same camera; this basic merge does not include moving-subject deghosting. Source adjustments are excluded from the merge.
